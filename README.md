# ðŸŒˆ p5.js Template for the CodeSandbox IDE ðŸ¦„

[p5.js](https://p5js.org/) is for me the best JavaScript library for creative coding. The project also has an [online editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) that is very suitable for beginners but limited for more advanced projects. My favorite JavaScript online IDE is [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) with a reasonable [feature set](https://codesandbox.io/ide) and here I provide a nice p5.js template to get started right away.
